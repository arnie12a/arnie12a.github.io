                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">After graduating from UW-Madison in December 2023, I wanted to explore around India. Here is a little blog post highlighting my trip.</p>
                <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">I picked one photo from every place I went to and wrote about it. Trust me this was a hard thing to do because there were so many beautiful pictures.</p>

                <p class="mb-4 py-4">A sprawling garden covering a 240 acres piece of land in the center of the city, Lalbagh Botanic Garden is a major attraction in Bangalore. It offers tranquility in a city that is always on the move. Here, hundreds of couples and people soak in this comfort, making it a great place to just chill:)</p>
                <p class="mb-2">I specifically saw these two stray dogs with nice ambient lighting and thought it would make for the perfect settings to capture this vibe of the botanic garden. And the addition of the trees, shrubs, and benches only amplified this feeling. With the very hot weather, I do not blame the dogs for catching some shade.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 py-4">Raigad Fort, situated near Pune, was the mountain stronghold of the legendary Maratha king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. His empire extended throughout Maharastra but this strategic position was designated to be the capital of the Maratha empire.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The rope way had a queue of 2 hours so my Dad and I decided to hike up to the fort. So after two hours of climbing and admiring the beautiful landscape, we reached the top. The area reminded me a lot of Utah but is on the other side of the globe.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">An interesting fact to know is that when the British left India, they destroyed as much as they could. Raigad Fort was just one of many places that was completely gutted out. So I wanted to show some destroyed structures with the beautiful view in the backdrop.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 py-4">Mount Kanchenjunga, towering over the state of Sikkim, is the third tallest mountain in the world. The name Kanchenjunga is derived from four words of Tibetian origin which is interpreted as the "Five Treasuries of the Great Snow" after its five peaks and has alays been worshipped by the people of Sikkim. </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The sheer size of this mountain is hard to comprehend. The best way to articulate it is by taking a vertical landscape photo highlighting the surrounding valleys that eventually lead up to the peak. I am happy with how it turned out but still does not compare to seeing it with my own eyes.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Seeing the environmental and cultural significance that Kanchenjunga presents to Sikkim and its people was really cool to see. I cannot wait to return and do some further exploring.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4 py-4">Nestled in the picturesque hills of Kerala, Munnar captivates with its lush tea plantations, misty mountains, and serene beauty, offering a tranquil escape into nature's embrace. And on this hike I was able to see all of this within the span of two hours hiking up the mountain.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">At the beginning of the hike, I was literally walking through the tea plantation on the side of the hill. And I saw workers picking tea leaves and putting it into their big sacks. Eventually, you hit higher elevation and the tea leaves go away. Then you are just walking up grasslandish type path up to the top giving the best view of Munnar. Love how greenery of the area and it was only March and wonder how beautiful the area is during the Monsoon. So next time I come back will be then.</p>

The Matrimandir's architecture is beautiful with its spherical shape and it being cladded in golden discs represents the sun. And the Matrimandir is completely surrounded by a garden which could symbolize a lot of things. First thing I can think of is it represents life on earth. Everything comes from the sun so it is only logical.</p>
